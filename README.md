# SPI-master-RHS2116
SPI logic to interface with the RHS2116 chip ([link](https://intantech.com/RHS_headstages.html?tabSelect=RHS32ch)), for FPGA. 

Info:
- CPOL = 0 
- CPHA = 0

For detailed information about the SPI requirements, refer to Intan RHS2116 Datasheet.
The SPI has been validated for an FPGA architecture running at 100MHz, and it is optimized to customization
